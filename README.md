This is a DEMO project. Don't expect a HUGE project. I focused on simple actions, and they are working properly. Of course this is work in progress.

Topics used: 

- Page Object Model (Fixtures & Commands files)
- Simple test case using commands
- CI/CD between Jenkins & Github
- Jenkins interface editted, cron defined and project executed periodically. 

Readme Editted for checking Jenkins automatically updates.
